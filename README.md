## Objective

This project aims to analyze the Black Friday sales data to gain insights into customer behavior, popular products, and purchase trends during the Black Friday sale. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customer demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts.

## Steps
    1. Imported necessary Python libraries and Dataset.
    2. Performed EDA.
    3. Visualized Gender gap, Distribution of Occupation, Pistribution of Purchase etc.
    4. Visualized the Probability plot of Purchase.
    5. Split the data into training and test sets and proceed further by training a Black Friday sale model using Linear regression with Ridge and Lasso and also with GradientBoostingRegressor.
